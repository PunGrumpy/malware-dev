## `📝` Description

This script demonstrates shellcode injection into a target process on a Windows system. It leverages the Windows API functions and process manipulation techniques to allocate memory within a target process and inject custom shellcode into it.

> **Note**: This script is for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for any damage done using this script. If you are using this script, you are agreeing that you will not use this code for malicious purposes.

## `📚` Pre-Requisites

- [Windows Operating System](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows)
- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Visual C++ Compiler](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) (For Compiling Shellcode)
- Process ID (PID) of Target Process to Inject Shellcode Into

> **Note**: You can use any version of Python 3, but I recommend using Python 3.11.

## `📖` Usage

1. Ensure the prerequisites mentioned above are met.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Execute the script with the following command:

   ```shell
   python dll-injection.py (Get-Process | ?{$_.ProcessName -eq "<PROCESS>"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Id)
   ```

   Replace `<PROCESS>` with the name of the target process you want to inject the shellcode into.

   > **Note**: Exercise caution when choosing the target process and ensure you have appropriate permissions to access and modify it.

4. The script will attempt to inject the dll into the target process. The output will provide information about the status of various operations, including obtaining a handle to the process, allocating memory, writing the shellcode, creating a remote thread, and waiting for the thread to finish execution.

5. If successful, you should see a message indicating that the thread finished executing. Otherwise, error messages will be displayed to indicate any issues encountered during the injection process.

> **Note**: DLL injection and related techniques can be potentially dangerous and may have legal and ethical implications. Ensure that you have a valid and legitimate use case before using this script.
