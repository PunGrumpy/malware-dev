## `📝` Description

Reverse Shell is a Python script that establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server. It allows remote command execution and provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with the remote system.

The reverse shell technique involves a remote client connecting to a listening server and then executing commands on the server. This approach is useful in scenarios where the server is behind a firewall or has restricted access, allowing the client to initiate the connection and bypass those restrictions.

## `📚` Pre-Requisites

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Netcat](https://eternallybored.org/misc/netcat/) (For Testing)

> **Note**: You can use any version of Python 3, but I recommend using Python 3.11.

## `📖` Usage

1. Ensure the prerequisites mentioned above are met.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Execute the script with the following command:

   ```shell
   python reverse_shell.py [--ip=<ip>] [--port=<port>] [--encrypt]
   python reverse_shell.py [-h | --help]

   # or

   python reverse_shell.py
   ```

   Replace `<IP>` with the IP address of the server and `<PORT>` with the port number to listen on.
   Encrypt the connection using the `--encrypt` flag. This will encrypt the connection using AES encryption.

   > **Note**: Ensure that the port you specify is not blocked by a firewall or in use by another application.
